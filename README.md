# The-Number-Guessing-Game-
I created this program based on a prompt from a co-worker who's taken me under his wing and helping me learn programming and programming hygiene.
Although this program was simple in logic it was challenging in the sense I had to recall a big chunk of the lessons I learned in my programming class. Furthermore, this game was also fun to structure i.e. picking the feedback from the computer, I tried to find ASCII art I could utilize and make it more visually interesting but I was unable to find appropriate art. Nonetheless, I am gonna keep an eye and commit to projects that can and will utilize the art in the future.

If you made it this far I'd like to sincerely thank you, I appreciate the support.
